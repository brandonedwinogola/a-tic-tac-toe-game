Tic Tac Toe
A simple Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


# JavaScript Code 
This code uses jQuery to handle click events on the cells of the Tic Tac Toe grid and the reset button. It also defines a checkForWin() function that checks all possible winning combinations of the grid and a reset() function that clears the grid and resets the game.

When a cell is clicked, the code checks if there is a winner or if the cell is already filled. If the conditions are met, it places the current player's mark in the cell, checks for a win, and updates the status text.


# How to play
The game is played on a 3x3 grid
Player 1 is "X" and Player 2 is "O"
Players take turns placing their mark on the grid by clicking on an empty cell
The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game
If all cells are filled and no one has won, the game is a tie
